I looked for some inspirations and some sources recommended by the professor about the telepresence.

First, the [telegarden](http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/garden/Ars/) 1995-2004. This was a pioneer in this field. A garden cultivated remotely by people around the world. The most archaic science united to the top technology. That was a huge success.

Some other exciting work done about telepresence can be seen [here](http://www.ekac.org/interactive.html). The most interesting one for me is the "Ornitorrinco project" that presented a robot remote controlled that send the image of his location to his control station (and that was achieved at the 90's! the beginning of Internet consolidation).

[Double 2](http://www.doublerobotics.com/) by Double Robotics is a more high-tech and modern model similar to the Ornitorrinco. It also displays the controller image. A nice unpacking and testing video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXPuBd4IfQ8).

And at last a very inspiring robot that displays the [future of telepresence](http://www.vocativ.com/323957/finally-a-robot-assistant-as-affordable-as-it-is-adorable/).
