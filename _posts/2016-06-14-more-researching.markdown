I looked for some inspirations and some sources recommended by the professor about the telepresence.

First, the [telegarden](http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/garden/Ars/) 1995-2004. This was a pioneer in this field. A garden cultivated remotely by people around the world. The most archaic science united to the top technology. That was a huge success.

Some other exciting work done about telepresence can be seen (here)[http://www.ekac.org/interactive.html]. The most interesting one for me is the "Ornitorrinco project" that presented a robot remote controlled that send the image of his location to his control station (and that was achieved at the 90's! the beginning of Internet consolidation).
