The resource from the previous post --NOVIKOV, Petr. Robohub. Architectural robotics: The shape of the robots that will shape your home. Available at: [http://robohub.org/architectural-robotics-shape-of-the-robots-that-will-shape-your-home-in-dom-reconfigurable-spaces/]-- really inspired me! So I wanted to reinvent the process of construction somehow. I tried to dig into the construction processes, but they were kind of complicated to be understood in such a short time, as I need. I talked to a ~specialist~ (aka, my brother, the civil engineer), and he recommended me to quit it. BUT, gave me other ideas.

So I tried to go into the adaptive architecture. I found a really interesting source that go through all the needed concepts: [Adaptive Architecture - A Conceptual Framework by Holger Schn√§delbach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235218510_Adaptive_Architecture_-_A_Conceptual_Framework)

Into this line, there's this amazing place, the [Carlo Ratti Associati's Office 3.0](http://www.dezeen.com/2016/06/03/office-3-0-carlo-ratti-internet-of-things-personalised-environments-turin-italy/) that uses a bunch of sensors connected and constantly collecting data (IoT!) and changing the environment all the time. It goes from changes at the lighting, the cooling and heating system to physical changes with movable glass walls!

I saw a therm that I didn't know what meant, so I googled it, of course. It's the [Mixed Reality Architecture](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/5168/2/5168.pdf). And it is pretty interesting. Just check this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HAUThWxidQ). So, I think I may be changing my mind.

I was having a hard time before. I had some ideas of paradigms and line of thinking, but I could not materialize it. With the Mixed Reality Architecture, I'm having some ideas. 
Soon more about that.
