The resource from the previous post --NOVIKOV, Petr. Robohub. Architectural robotics: The shape of the robots that will shape your home. Available at: [http://robohub.org/architectural-robotics-shape-of-the-robots-that-will-shape-your-home-in-dom-reconfigurable-spaces/]-- really inspired me! So I wanted to reinvent the process of construction somehow. I tried to dig into the construction processes, but they were kind of complicated to be understood in such a short time, as I need. I talked to a ~specialist~ (aka, my brother, the civil engineer), and he recommended me to quit it. BUT, gave me other ideas.

So I tried to go into the adaptive architecture. I found a really interesting source that go through all the needed concepts: [Adaptive Architecture - A Conceptual Framework by Holger Schn√§delbach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235218510_Adaptive_Architecture_-_A_Conceptual_Framework)
